# Cricket-Mania
This is a mini cricket simulation in which is build using C programming language in which there will be 2 players one is user and other is computer. It was made more attractive by using coloured texts and patterns. It is a fun game and really worth it.  There are certain rules for this game: #1 You get to enter your name #2 Whoever wins the toss, chooses either to bat or bowl #3 You need to choose one number from 1,2,4 and 6 only. #4 If the number you choose and the computer choose are the same, then the batsman gets out #5 If numbers are different then the number you throw gets added to the score #6 After the batsman gets out, the first innings will be done #7 The total score will be set as the target and the opponent will have to chase that score #8 If the target is achieved, that player will win the game.  The main aspect of the game lies in random number generation which will explained in detail later. Each and every permutation results in a completely different game, so it is worth to get entertained from this program that we designed.
